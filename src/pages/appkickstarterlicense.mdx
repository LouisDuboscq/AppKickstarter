## Agreement to Terms and Conditions
This Agreement takes effect on the date on which you first use the AppKickstarter application.

You may not redistribute or re-sell the source code.

## Source code

AppKickstarter does not provide technical support for modified source code. The SOFTWAREâ€™s source code is provided as is. In the event that you develop any troubleshooting-related modifications of the SOFTWARE, AppKickstarter will not be responsible for troubleshooting these issues. You are granted the right to use such modifications as set forth in this agreement.

Licensee is granted one license to use the Software as the basis of up to three applications so long as those applications are owned and operated by Licensee or Licensee's clients.

## Redistribution Rights

Licensee reasonably ensures that the Software is not distributed in any form that allows it to be reused by any application other than Licensee's solution. Licensee must inform customers that they are not allowed to use the Software independently and that to redistribute the Software, they must obtain an appropriate license from appkickstarter.

Licensee may not redistribute the Software to anyone via any means other than to customers as part of a purchased, integrated solution that includes functionality beyond that provided solely by the Software.

## Disclaimer

It is not warranted that AppKickstarter will meet your requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or error-free. All express and implied warranties or conditions not stated in this Agreement (including without limitation, loss of profits, loss or corruption of data, business interruption or loss of contracts), so far as such exclusion or disclaimer is permitted under the applicable law are excluded and expressly disclaimed. This Agreement does not affect your statutory rights.

## Responsibilities
