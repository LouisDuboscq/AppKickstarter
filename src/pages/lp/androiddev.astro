As an Android developer, expand your skills and revenue with multi-platform development

You know Kotlin and Compose - but iOS development seems out of reach.

## iOS development is complex

Swift is a difficult language to learn
Xcode and iOS SDK are complex
Building iOS apps requires Mac hardware
This limits your skills, revenue potential, and ability to target the large iOS user base.

## With AppKickstarter, you can now easily build iOS apps using the same Kotlin and Compose technologies you already know.

AppKickstarter uses:

Kotlin Multiplatform: Write 100% of your code once, share 90%+ between Android and iOS
Compose Multiplatform: Use the same Compose UI framework on both platforms
Firebase: Integrate the same Firebase SDKs on iOS and Android

This means:

No Swift required: Build iOS apps entirely with Kotlin
No Mac needed: Develop on any machine
Faster development: Reuse most of your Android code
