AppKickstarter UI Kit is a collection of clean and simple interface components that you can use to create visually appealing and intuitive app interfaces.

This UI Kit has been built on top of material 3 and following Atomic Design principles. 

It is meant to be used as building blocks, and not as a complete solution.

## Multiplatform

The UI Kit is built with Jetbrain Compose which supports Android and desktop (macos, windows, linux)

## Theming

### Pre-built Theming

There are alredy pre-built themes in AppKickstarter with ready to use colors, fonts, and in-app theming management. 

Indeed, user can easily change theme (colors, fonts) , and can change brightness(dark , light or system colors). 


<div class="py-6 md:order-1 hidden md:block">
    <img src={onboardingGif} alt="AppKickstarter onboarding"/>
</div>


### Customization 

There are alredy pre-built themes in AppKickstarter but if you want to provide your own palette colors you can easily customize it.

```
CustomColors(
    background = color1,
    textOnBackground = color2, 
    buttonBackground = color3,
    textOnButton = color4,
    ...
)
```

Then you need to wrap all your layouts in the KickstarterTheme.

```
KickstarterTheme(
    selectedTheme = selectedTheme, // name of theme you coded
    selectedThemeBrightness = selectedThemeBrightness, // dark, light or system
) {
  // content
}
```
