AppKickstarter UI Kit is a collection of clean and simple interface components that works on Android, iOS and desktop. 

You can use it to create visually appealing and intuitive app interfaces.

This UI Kit has been built on top of material 3 and following Atomic Design principles. 

It is meant to be used as building blocks, and not as a complete solution.

## Multiplatform

The UI Kit is built with Jetbrain Compose which supports Android and desktop (macos, windows, linux)

## Theming

### Pre-built Theming

There are alredy pre-built themes in AppKickstarter with ready to use colors, fonts, and in-app theming management. 

Indeed, user can easily change theme (colors, fonts) , and can change brightness(dark , light or system colors).

### Customization 

There are alredy pre-built themes in AppKickstarter but if you want to provide your own palette colors you can easily customize it.

```kotlin
CustomColors(
    background = color1,
    textOnBackground = color2, 
    buttonBackground = color3,
    textOnButton = color4,
    ...
)
```

Then you need to wrap all your layouts in the KickstarterTheme.

```kotlin
KickstarterTheme(
    selectedTheme = selectedTheme, // name of theme you coded
    selectedThemeBrightness = selectedThemeBrightness, // dark, light or system
) {
  // content
}
```
