Share translations and resources such as images across multiple platforms. Do it once and then use them on multiple platforms, saving time and effort

```kotlin
object Localizable {
    fun email(): StringDesc = StringDesc.resource(email)
    fun password(): StringDesc = StringDesc.resource(password)
}
```

<main
  class="grid lg:grid-cols-2 place-items-center pt-16 pb-8 md:pt-12 md:pb-24">
    <div class="py-6 md:order-1 md:block"> 
        <Image 
            src="/images/loginen.jpg"
            width="400"
            height="400" />
        <span>English translations</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Image 
            src="/images/loginfr.jpg"
            width="400"
            height="400"
        />
        <span>French translations</span>
