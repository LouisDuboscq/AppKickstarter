AppKickstarter manages authentication and user management thanks to Firebase authentication. 
We facilitates various user account management functions, including logging in, 
signing up, resetting forgotten passwords (which are sent via email), and logging out (which navigates back to the login page).

## Firebase authentication

We provide a ready to use login and sign up screen with Firebase provider. 
All you need to do is display this composable and it just works.

```kotlin
EmailPasswordFormFirebase(
    onSuccess = { currentUser ->

    }
)
```

## Log in, sign up and reset password screens

<p class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-10">  
 <img src="/images/login-ios.png" alt="Login screen in AppKickstarter" width="300" /> 
 <img src="/images/signup-ios.png" alt="Signup screen in AppKickstarter" width="300" /> 
 <img src="/images/forgot-password-ios.png" alt="Forgot password screen in AppKickstarter" width="300" /> 
</p>

## Custom provider 

If you want to have a custom implementation for the login and sign up logic but still enjoy the pre-built UI, you can do this :

```kotlin
var isSignUp by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

LoginAndSignupScreen(
    isSignUp = isSignUp,
    createAccount = { email, password ->
        authScope.launch { createAccount(email, password) }
    },
    signInWith = { email, password ->
        authScope.launch { signInWith(email, password) }
    },
    resetPassword = { emailToReset -> 
        scope.launch {
            auth.resetPassword(emailToReset)
        }
    }
)
```

This way, you do what you want with the email and password.
