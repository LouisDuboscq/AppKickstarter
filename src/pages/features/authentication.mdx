## Firebase login and sign up

We provide a ready to use login and sign up screen with Firebase provider. All you need to do is display this composable and it just works.

```
EmailPasswordFormFirebase(
    onSuccess = { currentUser ->

    }
)
```

## Custom provider 

If you want to have a custom implementation for the login and sign up logic but still enjoy the interface, you can do this :

```
var isSignUp by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

LoginAndSignupScreen(
    isSignUp = isSignUp,
    createAccount = { email, password ->
        scope.launch { createAccount(email, password) }
    },
    signInWith = { email, password ->
        scope.launch { signInWith(email, password) }
    },
    toggleMode = { isSignUp = !isSignUp }
)
```

This way, you do what you want with the email and password.
