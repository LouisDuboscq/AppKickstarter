RevenueCat offers a convenient solution for implementing and managing in-app purchases and subscriptions by providing a backend and wrapper 
that works with Apple's StoreKit and Google Play Billing. 
With RevenueCat, there's no need to worry about server maintenance or writing backend code, as the process is simplified and streamlined.

## Definitions

This section is based on [RevenueCat documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements) :
What are entitlements, offerings and products ?

### Products

Products are the individual SKUs that users actually purchase. The stores (Apple, Google, Stripe, and Amazon) process these SKUs and charge the user.

### Entitlements

An entitlement represents a level of access, features, or content that a user is "entitled" to.
Entitlements are used to ensure a user has appropriate access to content based on their purchases, without having to manage all of the product identifiers in your app code.
Most apps only have one entitlement, unlocking all premium features. However, if you had two tiers of content such as Gold and Platinum, you would have 2 entitlements.
Once entitlements are created, you should attach products to entitlements.
When a product that is attached to an entitlement is purchased, that entitlement becomes active for the duration of the product.

### Offerings

Offerings are the selection of products that are "offered" to a user on your paywall. They're an optional, but recommended feature of RevenueCat that can make it easier to change and experiment with your paywalls.
If you've configured Offerings in RevenueCat, you can control which products are shown to users without requiring an app update. Building paywalls that are dynamic and can react to different product configurations gives you maximum flexibility to make remote updates.

## Subscriptions

## One time purchasess

- Lifetime deals are supported. 
- Consumables IAP are not supported. 

## Setup

In RevenueCat, when you add a new product :
Subscription : name of sub (which can have free tier for example) 
Base plan : name of the general plan (folder in google play console)

Check now Store Status, it should be OK. if you have Not found there's an error.
