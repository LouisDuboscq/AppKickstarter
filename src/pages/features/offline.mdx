Offer a smooth user experience within your app with effective data management techniques such as caching, fetching, and synchronization.
You can even use your app in a submarine !

## SqlDelight

We use SQLDelight for offline database. SQLDelight is a multiplatform library for Kotlin that provides a type-safe way to write SQL queries 
for your applications. 
It allows you to define your database schema in a Kotlin interface, and generates code to help you easily access your database in a type-safe way. 

One of the main advantages of SQLDelight is that it catches errors at compile-time, rather than at runtime, 
which helps prevent bugs and makes it easier to maintain your code. 
Additionally, SQLDelight provides a number of useful features, 
such as support for migrations, easy integration with other Kotlin libraries, and the ability to write tests for your database queries.

## Caching, Fetching and synchronization

We provide ready to use background tasks that try to periodically execute your commands (cache, fetch, synchronize) based on SqlDelight.
Your data is by default to be synchronized, and when your data is synchronized on your server, simply call :

```
yourTableQueries.setSynchronized(objectId)
```

## Included

AppKickstarter includes a preconfigured database with the latest library version, a sample table, 
and instructions on how to access the database. 
Additionally, we provide Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) methods, as well as observability based on the Flow type.
