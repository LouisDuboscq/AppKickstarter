Morse code is a simple yet ingenious system for communicating text through a series of short and long tones, lights or clicks.

Developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse, it allowed people to send messages over long distances using electrical telegraphs.

And at its core, Morse code uses a simple system of dots and dashes to represent letters of the alphabet.

The alphabet in Morse code consists of a series of short "dit" and long "dah" sounds corresponding to dots and dashes.


Each letter is separated by a short silence, while words are separated by a longer silence. Here is a table of the alphabet in Morse code:


<div class="container mx-auto">
  <table class="min-w-full bg-white border border-gray-300">
    <thead>
      <tr class="bg-gray-100">
        <th class="py-2 px-4 border-b">Letter</th>
        <th class="py-2 px-4 border-b">Morse Code</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">A</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">.-</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">B</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">-...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">C</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">-.-.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">D</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">-..</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">E</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">F</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">..-.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">G</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">--.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">H</td>
        <td class="py-2 px-4 border-b">....</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
