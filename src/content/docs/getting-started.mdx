## Getting started

### Start a new project on Github

Once you have purchased the template from Lemon Squeezie, you will have access to the AppKickstarter Github repository.

- Open Github and go to "New repository"
- Select "Repository template" and choose "AppKickstarter/AppKickstarterTemplate"
- Change the owner to you and set your repository name
- Make the repository private and click "Generate"

### Clone it into your IDE

After creating the repository, copy the ssh address from Github and open Android Studio.

- Click on "Get from VCS"
- Paste the address and click "Clone"

### Run the setup script

- Open the readme file in Android Studio
- Click on "Setup template" (or use Ctrl+Click)
- Follow the prompts to enter your app name and package name
- Next, click on the Firebase link to set up your backend
- Create a new Firebase project, name it, and select your account
- Add an Android app, enter the package name from step 3, and download the google-services.json file
- Copy the google-services.json file to your Android app module in Android Studio
- Return to the script and press enter to continue


Make sure to add in iosApp/iosApp (at same level as Info.plist) the Google-service-Info.plist via Xcode. 
If you don't add it via xcode you'll have an error at startup (at firebase initialization)

In your app target, in xcode, change the product name to your app name if it is still AppKickstarter

### Firebase setup

You have to change the authentication rules in Firebase to this : 

``` 
// Allow read/write access on all documents to any user signed in to the application
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Synchronize and run the app

- Synchronize Gradle files
- Run the app on Android and iOS
