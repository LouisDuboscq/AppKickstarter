## Key-value storage

With AppKickstarter, you can easily store key-value data using the com.russhwolf.settings dependency. This feature is compatible with both Android and iOS and the base is already set up for your project.
 
## Offline database

AppKickstarter also provides an offline database using the sqldelight dependency, which works on both Android and iOS. The base is already configured for your project, so you can start using the database right away.
