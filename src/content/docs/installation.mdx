## Environment Variables

AppKickstarter provides a secure file to store all the API keys and secrets for your project. 
This file is declared on the gitignore by default, so it is not included in the template or your project's GitHub remote repository. 
The file, called local.properties, is stored locally, which means that all the secrets are not accessible if someone tries to reverse engineer the app on the Play Store. 
Your secrets are safe.

To get started with AppKickstarter, you need to set up your own data.


## Signing Configuration

Your signing configurations are stored securely in the local.properties file by default. To customize your project and make it compile, you need to fill in your own parameters:


````
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=path/to/your/jks
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
````

## Apis

AppKickstarter comes with handy support for multiple useful tools linked to an API. We believe that these tools are useful in most cases, but note that all of the below APIs are optional. You can take what you need and leave the others empty.

### Subscriptions

If your app supports in-app subscriptions, you need to write down your [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) API key: 

```
revenue_cat_api_key=your_api_key
```

### AI 

AI is a trending topic right now, and we want to help you kickstart your next ideas. 
There are a lot of things to discover, which is why we have pre-built the basic usage of an AI app for you. 

#### OpenAI

If your app supports AI features, such as ChatGPT, GPT3.5-turbo, GPT-4, etc., you need to write down your [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key:

```
openai_api_key=your_api_key
```

#### ControlNet

If you want to build features with [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) and [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), you need to write down your API key:

```
replicate_api_key=your_api_key
```

### Real-time Notifications and Analytics

If you want to receive real-time notifications about the usage of your app by users, we support [Logsnag](https://logsnag.com/) for this. All you need to do is to write down your API key:

```
logsnag_api_key=your_api_key
```

There is a pre-built multi-platform code to call [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com). 
If you want to use it, you simply need to write down your API key:

```
amplitude_api_key=your_api_key
```
