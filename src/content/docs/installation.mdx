We understand the importance of a smooth setup experience, and that's why we've made it easy for you by consolidating all user environment variables and data in the local.properties.example file."

To get started, all you need to do is copy the values from local.properties.example into your local.properties file. We'll guide you step-by-step, ensuring a seamless and efficient setup process. So, let's dive in and kickstart your app development journey with AppKickstarter!

## Environment Variables

AppKickstarter prioritizes the security of your project by offering a dedicated file to store all API keys and secrets. 

This file, named local.properties, is automatically added to the .gitignore, ensuring it remains excluded from the template and your project's GitHub remote repository. 
As a result, your sensitive information stays protected, even if someone attempts to reverse engineer the app on the Play Store.

To begin your journey with AppKickstarter, simply set up your own data within the local.properties file, and enjoy a secure and streamlined development experience.

## Signing Configuration

Your signing configurations are stored securely in the local.properties file by default. To customize your project and make it compile, you need to fill in your own parameters:


````
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=path/to/your/jks
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
````

## Apis

AppKickstarter comes with handy support for multiple useful tools linked to an API. 
We believe that these tools are useful in most cases, but note that all of the below APIs are optional. 
You can take what you need and leave the others empty.

### Subscriptions

If your app supports in-app subscriptions, you need to write down your [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) API key: 

```
revenue_cat_api_key=your_api_key
```

### Real-time Notifications and Analytics

If you want to receive real-time notifications about the usage of your app by users, we support [Logsnag](https://logsnag.com/) for this. All you need to do is to write down your API key:

```
logsnag_api_key=your_api_key
```

There is a pre-built multi-platform code to call [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com). 
If you want to use it, you simply need to write down your API key:

```
amplitude_api_key=your_api_key
```
