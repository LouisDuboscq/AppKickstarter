AppKickstarter simplifies authentication and user management using Firebase authentication, 
providing a ready-to-use login and sign-up screen with various account management functions like logging in, signing up, resetting forgotten passwords (sent via email), 
and logging out (navigating back to the login page from the settings screen). 
Additionally, users can implement a custom login and sign-up logic while still using the pre-built UI by utilizing the LoginAndSignupScreen composable with customizable parameters.

## Firebase authentication

Our app offers a pre-built login and sign up screen with Firebase provider that is readily available for use. 
Simply display the composable and it will function seamlessly.

```kotlin
EmailPasswordFormFirebase(
    onSuccess = { currentUser ->

    }
)
```

## Screens

<p class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-10">  
 <img src="/images/login-ios.png" alt="Login screen in AppKickstarter" width="300" /> 
 <img src="/images/signup-ios.png" alt="Signup screen in AppKickstarter" width="300" /> 
 <img src="/images/forgot-password-ios.png" alt="Forgot password screen in AppKickstarter" width="300" /> 
</p>

## Custom provider 

You can customize the login and sign up logic while still utilizing the pre-built UI by implementing the following code in Kotlin:

```kotlin
var isSignUp by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

LoginAndSignupScreen(
    isSignUp = isSignUp,
    createAccount = { email, password ->
        authScope.launch { createAccount(email, password) }
    },
    signInWith = { email, password ->
        authScope.launch { signInWith(email, password) }
    },
    resetPassword = { emailToReset -> 
        scope.launch {
            auth.resetPassword(emailToReset)
        }
    }
)
```

This allows you to manipulate the email and password according to your specific needs.
