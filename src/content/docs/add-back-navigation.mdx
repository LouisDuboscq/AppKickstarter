Given you have a screen that navigates to another : 

```kotlin
@Composable 
fun Screen1Content() {
    PrimaryButton(
        text = "navigate to 2",
        onClick = {} 
    )
}

@Composable
object Screen2: Screen {
    @Composable
    override fun Content() {
        Screen2Content()
    }
}

@Composable
fun Screen2Content() {
    Text("Screen 2")
}
```

To make navigation to screen 2 you just need to call push on a navigator instance : 

```kotlin
@Composable 
fun Screen1Content() {
    val navigator = LocalNavigator.currentOrThrow
    PrimaryButton(
        text = "navigate to 2",
        onClick = { navigator.push(Screen2) } 
    )
}
```

To navigate back from the second screen and have the back icon you just have to wrap your content inside KickstarterScaffold component : 

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Screen2Content( 
    navigateBack: () -> Unit,
) {
    KickstarterScaffold(
        title = "Screen 2",
        navigateBack = navigateBack
    ) {
        // todo render your amazing screen content
    }
}  
```

Finally, you need to pass navigateBack to Screen2Content from Screen2 composable :

```kotlin
@Composable
object Screen2: Screen {
    @Composable
    override fun Content() {
        val navigator = LocalNavigator.currentOrThrow
        Screen2Content(navigateBack = navigator::pop)
    }
}
```

Note that we could create the navigator instance in Screen2Content and do pop in this component. 
But we don't want to have navigation dependencies in content composables so that they are pure : they only takes datas and callbacks, dependending only on Compose UI.
