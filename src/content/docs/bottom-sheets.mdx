The KickstarterBottomSheet component is a versatile component designed to help you display an Adaptive Bottom Sheet with Android and iOS aesthetics. 

This component simplifies the management of various aspects, such as sheet visibility, colors, spacings, onDismissRequest callback, and automatic hiding upon clicking an element.
 
## Theming

The default container color of the KickstarterBottomSheet is derived from the KickstarterTheme and the user's preferred theme (light, dark, or system). 

The entire theme within AppKickstarter is highly customizable to suit your needs.

### Adaptive rendering 

<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
    <div>
        <img src="/images/bottom-sheet-dark.png" alt="Dark Theme Bottom Sheet" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="/images/bottom-sheet-light.png" alt="Light Theme Botttom Sheet" />
    </div>
    <div> 
        <img src="/images/AdaptiveBottomSheet-ios.png" alt="iOS Botttom Sheet" />
    </div>
</div> 
  
## API

To use the KickstarterBottomSheet, you need to provide it with a `MutableState<Boolean>` to control the visibility of the Adaptive Bottom Sheet. 
Additionally, you'll need to specify a list of ItemSheetContentData elements, each containing an icon, text, and an onClick callback.

```kotlin
KickstarterBottomSheet(
    openBottomSheetTheme,
    listOf(
        ItemSheetContentData(
            Icons.Rounded.DarkMode,
            selectDarkTheme,
            "Dark"
        ),
        ItemSheetContentData(
            Icons.Rounded.LightMode,
            selectLightTheme,
            "Light",
        ),
        ItemSheetContentData(
            Icons.Rounded.Star,
            selectSystemTheme,
            "System",
        )
    )
)
```

Use this component to enhance your app's user experience by implementing a flexible and adaptive bottom sheet with ease.
