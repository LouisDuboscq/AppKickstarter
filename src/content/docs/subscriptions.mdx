AppKickstarter's billing management is powered by RevenueCat, which offers a streamlined solution for implementing and managing in-app purchases and subscriptions. 
RevenueCat provides a backend and wrapper that works with Apple's StoreKit and Google Play Billing, eliminating the need for server maintenance and backend coding.

## What AppKickstarter does for you

With AppKickstarter, you can display a pre-designed paywall screen that integrates RevenueCat's features seamlessly. 
The paywall screen includes information on yearly, monthly, and weekly plans, as well as discounts for yearly plans. 
Users can click on the plans to access the native payment option modal provided by their device.

## Setup

To set up the paywall, simply create your offerings in RevenueCat, and AppKickstarter will display the current offering on the paywall screen. 
We recommend setting up one package for annual, monthly, and weekly payments, as well as a one-time payment for lifetime access.

## Why RevenueCat and what it is

We chose RevenueCat for paywall management due to its numerous advantages, including easy implementation and maintenance of the SDK, comprehensive documentation, a single interface for managing Android and iOS data, 
and an analytics dashboard with charts and useful data. 
RevenueCat also offers A/B testing and offerings management, allowing you to adjust pricing in the backend.

In RevenueCat's terminology, products are individual SKUs that users purchase, entitlements represent levels of access or content that users are entitled to, and offerings are the selection of products offered to users on the paywall. 
With offerings, you can control which products are shown to users without requiring an app update, making it easier to change and experiment with your paywalls.
