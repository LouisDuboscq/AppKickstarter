## KickstarterPaywall

A enhanced paywall screen where you just have to setup your own header. 
The footer is already pre-built with all the plans in parameters.

```kotlin  
fun KickstarterPaywall(
    plans: List<UIBillingPlan>,
    onClickAlreadyPurchased: () -> Unit,
    onClickClose: () -> Unit,
    onClickContinue: (UIBillingPlan) -> Unit,
    onClickExplanation: () -> Unit,
    header: @Composable () -> Unit,
)
```

Example : 
 
```kotlin 
KickstarterPaywallAndroid(
    plans = revenueCatItems.toUIBillingPlans(),
    onClickAlreadyPurchased = ::restorePurchases,
    onClickClose = ::closePaywall,
    onClickContinue = ::onClickContinue,
    onClickExplanation = {},
    header = { SwipeAllFeatures() }
)
```
