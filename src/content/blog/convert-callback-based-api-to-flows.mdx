When working with multiple libraries, you may find yourself dealing with APIs that use callbacks. 
Converting these to use Kotlin Flows can help simplify your code.

## Converting to [Suspend Functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/composing-suspending-functions.html)

To illustrate this, let's look at the following function that uses callbacks :

```kotlin
fun getCustomerInfo(
    onError: (PurchasesError) -> Unit,
    onCustomerInfo: (CustomerInfo) -> Unit
) {
    Purchases.sharedInstance.getCustomerInfoWith(
        onError = { onError(it) },
        onSuccess = { onCustomerInfo(it) }
    )
}
```

We can simplify this by introducing suspend coroutines, but we still have callbacks:

```kotlin
fun getCustomerInfo(onError: (PurchasesError) -> Unit, onCustomerInfo: (CustomerInfo) -> Unit) {
    Purchases.sharedInstance.getCustomerInfoWith(onError, onCustomerInfo)
}
```

However, we can now remove the callbacks entirely and use suspendCoroutine instead:

```kotlin
suspend fun getCustomerInfo(onError: (PurchasesError) -> Unit): CustomerInfo {
    return suspendCoroutine { continuation ->
        Purchases.sharedInstance.getCustomerInfoWith(onError) { customerInfo ->
            continuation.resume(customerInfo)
        }
    }
}
```

This allows us to make our function suspend, so that the caller waits until continuation.resume is called.

### Best Practice

To further improve your code, it's best to use the following version of the function:

```kotlin
@Throw(PurchaseError:class)
suspend fun getCustomerInfo(): CustomerInfo {
    return suspendCoroutine { continuation ->
        Purchases.sharedInstance.getCustomerInfoWith({ throw PurchaseError()}) { customerInfo ->
            continuation.resume(customerInfo)
        }
    }
}
```

With the updated suspend function, the caller can now use the simplified code below to get the customer information:

```kotlin
val customerInfo = try {
    getCustomerInfo()
} catch (e: PurchasesError) {
    // handle error
}
```

## Converting to [Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)

Learn how to convert callback-based APIs to Kotlin Flows when working with multiple libraries. 
Callback-based APIs can be challenging to work with, and it's essential to know how to optimize them for Kotlin. 
Here's an example of a callback-based API that is not Kotlin-friendly:

```kotlin
fun getUserEvents(onSuccess: (UserEvents) -> Unit, onError: (Error) -> Unit) {
    FirebaseFirestore.getInstance()
        .collection("collection")
        .document("app")
        .addSnapshotListener {  snapshot, e ->
            if (e != null) onError(e)
            if (snapshot == null) { return@addSnapshotListener } 
            onSuccess(snapshot.getEvents())
        } 
}
```

Here's how to change it to support flow response:

```kotlin  
fun getUserEvents(): Flow<UserEvents> = callbackFlow {

    // Reference to use in Firestore
    var eventsCollection: CollectionReference? = null
    try {
        eventsCollection = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance()
            .collection("collection")
            .document("app")
    } catch (e: Throwable) {
        // If Firebase cannot be initialized, close the stream of data
        // flow consumers will stop collecting and the coroutine will resume
        close(e)
    }

    // Registers callback to firestore, which will be called on new events
    val subscription = eventsCollection?.addSnapshotListener { snapshot, _ ->
        if (snapshot == null) { return@addSnapshotListener }
        // Sends events to the flow! Consumers will get the new events
        try {
            offer(snapshot.getEvents())
        } catch (e: Throwable) {
            // Event couldn't be sent to the flow
        }
    }

    // The callback inside awaitClose will be executed when the flow is
    // either closed or cancelled.
    // In this case, remove the callback from Firestore
    awaitClose { subscription?.remove() }
} 
```

Converting callback-based APIs to Kotlin Flows can make them easier to work with and optimize for Kotlin. 
Follow the above code snippets to learn how to convert them efficiently.
