Limited Resources: Many founders operate with limited financial resources, making it challenging to invest in expensive development teams or software tools. They often seek cost-effective solutions that enable them to bootstrap their startups and allocate their resources efficiently.

Time Constraints: Founders typically have a multitude of responsibilities and limited time to allocate to app development. They need efficient tools that help them streamline the development process, allowing them to focus on other critical aspects of their business, such as strategy, marketing, and customer acquisition.

Technical Expertise: Not all founders possess extensive coding or development knowledge. They require user-friendly platforms that simplify the app development process and bridge the gap between their vision and technical implementation. A solution that reduces the reliance on complex coding and technical skills is highly valuable.

Speed to Market: Founders are often in a race against time to bring their products or services to market swiftly. They need tools that expedite the app development cycle, allowing them to launch their apps quickly and gain a competitive advantage.

Flexibility and Customization: Founders want the ability to create apps that align with their unique brand identity, user experience, and functionality. They seek solutions that offer customization options, enabling them to tailor their apps to their target audience and business requirements.

Ongoing Support and Maintenance: After app development, founders require ongoing support, updates, and maintenance to ensure the smooth operation of their apps. They value platforms that offer reliable technical support, comprehensive documentation, and access to a community for troubleshooting and guidance.

Scalability and Integration: As startups grow, founders need their apps to scale and adapt to increasing user demands. They look for solutions that offer scalability and integration capabilities, allowing their apps to seamlessly integrate with other tools and services as their business expands.
