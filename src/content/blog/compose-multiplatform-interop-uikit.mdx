Composing Compose and SwiftUI on iOS
Compose Multiplatform allows for seamless interoperability with native iOS frameworks like SwiftUI and UIKit. This enables two main use cases:
Embedding Compose views in SwiftUI
You can embed a Compose UI view directly in a SwiftUI view hierarchy. This allows you to build parts of your iOS app in Compose while integrating with existing SwiftUI views.
For example:
swift

Copy

struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ComposeView {
            // Compose UI here
        }
    }
}
Embedding SwiftUI/UIKit views in Compose
You can also embed SwiftUI and UIKit views like MapKit directly in your Compose UI. This gives you access to all of iOS's native UI components from within Compose.
For example:
kotlin

Copy

@Composable
fun MyComposeScreen() {  
    MapView()  // Embeds a MapKit MKMapView
}
This two-way interoperability gives you the best of both worlds - the flexibility of Compose's declarative UI framework with access to iOS's rich set of native UI components. You have the
