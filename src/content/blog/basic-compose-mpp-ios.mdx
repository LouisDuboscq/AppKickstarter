In this post, you'll learn how to render compose multiplatform composables into SwiftUI for iOS. 
If you're an Android developer, you'll see it's just a matter of putting the composables in the right place and removing the Android dependencies (Context, permissions, navigation, ...).

Before all, create a kotlin multiplatform module and add the compose multiplatform plugin (org.jetbrains.compose) and dependencies :

```kotlin
implementation(compose.runtime)
implementation(compose.foundation) 
implementation(compose.material3)
```

## 1. UI on shared module

Define your screen in shared module as you would build it in a simple Android Compose application.

```kotlin
@Composable
internal fun MyScreen() {
    Column {
        Text("Hello from compose")
        Button(onClick= {}) { Text("Click me")}
    }
}
```

Note the internal keyword, this is a current limitation in the compose multiplatform development. 

## 2. Expose the internal screen to use it later

On the androidMain module : 

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreenAndroid() {
    MyScreen()
}
```

On the iosMain module : 

```kotlin
fun MyScreenIos(): UIViewController = ComposeUIViewController {
    MyScreen()
}
```

## 3 Client apps

### Android

Simply call in the android app the exposed screen built in kotlin multiplatform module.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            MyScreenAndroid()
        }
    }
}
```

### iOS

Doing this, you made a Viewcontroller and you have to use UIViewControllerRepresentable to expose it as a standard SwiftUI component.

```swift
struct MyScreenToSwiftUI: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> UIViewController {
        return MyScreenIos()
    }
    
    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: UIViewController, context: Context) {
    }
}
````

Then you simply can call it in your Swift UI component :

````swift
@main
struct iOSApp: App { 
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MyScreenToSwiftUI()
        }
    }
}
````

That's all! You learned to render your first Compose multiplatform component in SwiftUI.
