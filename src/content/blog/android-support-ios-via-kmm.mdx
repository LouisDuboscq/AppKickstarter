I'll show you how you can do things you usually do only on the Android platform that can be supported with the language you know for the iOS platform. 

## Database

Room -> SQLDelight

Realm could also be an option but I haven't had the chance to try it. 

## Http calls

Retrofit -> Ktor client

## Key value storage

SharedPreferences -> Multiplatform-settings

## Serialization

Gson -> kotlinx.serialization
