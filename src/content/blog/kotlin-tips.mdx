## Elvis operator

Simplify your Kotlin code by using the Elvis operator to handle null values.  
Replace conditionals with ?: to provide default values. 
For example, 

```
val name = nullableName ?: "John Doe"
```
 
assigns nullableName to "name" if it's not null, otherwise assigns "John Doe".

## Delay

To improve code clarity and consistency in Kotlin, when using the coroutines delay() function, rather than using

```
delay(3000)
````

we recommended to use 

```
delay(3.seconds)
```
