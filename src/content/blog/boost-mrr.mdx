## Introduction

In this article, we'll explore actionable tips to optimize your MRR and propel your business to new heights.

## Implement a Paywall Post Onboarding

One effective way to improve MRR is by implementing a paywall after the onboarding process. Allow users to experience the value of your product during the onboarding phase, but once they reach a certain point or feature, prompt them to subscribe to unlock the full potential. This strategy helps convert trial users into paying customers, increasing your revenue stream.

## Leverage Freemium with Feature Limitations

Offering a [freemium version of your SaaS or mobile app can entice users to explore your product](freemium-is-not-a-business-model). However, strategically block certain features or limit access to advanced functionalities in the freemium version. When users encounter these restrictions and realize the added benefits of upgrading, they will be motivated to subscribe for a premium experience.

## Reduce Time to Value (TTV) and Trial Duration

[Shortening the Time to Value is a game-changer in improving MRR. Focus on delivering the core value](/free-trial-duration) of your offering to users as quickly as possible. By streamlining the onboarding process and ensuring users experience value early on, you can justify a shorter free trial period, leading to more conversions within the same timeframe.

## Persistent Upgrade Offer in the App

Keep the subscription upgrade offer visible at all times within your app. By prominently displaying the benefits of the premium version and the advantages of upgrading, you create constant exposure to the subscription options. This repeated exposure can sway users who are on the fence about subscribing, ultimately increasing your MRR.

## CTA for Upgrades in App Updates

Every time you release an app update with new features or improvements, include a "What's New" screen. Seize this opportunity to add a compelling Call-to-Action (CTA) for upgrading to the premium version. Highlight how the latest enhancements are exclusive to subscribers, further incentivizing users to convert.

## Implement A/B Testing

To optimize your MRR strategies, conduct A/B testing on various elements, such as the positioning of the paywall, the content of the upgrade CTA, or the feature limitations in the freemium version. Analyze user behavior and conversion rates to identify what resonates best with your audience and refine your approach accordingly.

## Conclusion

Improving the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of your SaaS or mobile app subscription requires a multi-faceted approach. By strategically implementing a post-onboarding paywall, leveraging a freemium model with feature limitations, and reducing Time to Value (TTV) to increase conversion rates, you can drive revenue growth. Additionally, by consistently promoting upgrades and seizing opportunities within the app to entice users to subscribe, you'll create a steady stream of revenue from your loyal customer base.

Remember, achieving sustainable MRR growth is an ongoing process. Continuously analyze data, monitor user behavior, and adapt your strategies to meet the evolving needs of your customers. By doing so, you'll be well-positioned to enhance MRR and drive the long-term success of your SaaS or mobile app subscription business.
