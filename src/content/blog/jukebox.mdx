Tired of spending hours coding your media player? Let Jukebox handle it for you - so you can focus on what you do best: building beautiful UIs with Jetpack Compose!

Introducing Jukebox, an android library that helps you focusing on your audio UI and manages independently media player under the hood.

It’s built on top of jetpack compose and media player. And the focus is on flexibility to change loading, error and audio views.

Here are more infos on it :

## Launch the Jukebox composable

As I said, the goal is to provide an abstraction of audio management and easy to customize audio view.

## Change the audio view
