## The problem

If you intend to use a sealed class from a Kotlin multiplatform module in a Swift client, 
you can access the information, but you won't be able to use it as an enum in Swift. 
This is because the generated Swift code for a sealed class does not translate to an enum in Swift.

Indeed if you define a sealed class, such as the one shown below:

```kotlin
sealed class Destination(val path: String, val icon: ImageVector) {
    object Home : Destination("home", Icons.Rounded.Home)
    object Storybook : Destination("storybook", Icons.Rounded.Refresh)
    object Settings : Destination("settings", Icons.Rounded.Settings)
}
```

The only possible way to instantiate a `Destination` in Swift is as follows:

```swift
let destination: Destination = Destination.Home()
``` 

when we want to do this :

```swift
let destination: Destination = .home
```

So, how to make these sealed classes more Swift-friendly?

## Solution

We are going to use [KSwift library](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-kswift), a Swift-friendly api generator for Kotlin/Native frameworks. 

Add in root build.gradle

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        google()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("dev.icerock.moko:kswift-gradle-plugin:0.6.1")
    }
}
````

Add in project build.gradle

```
plugins {
    id("dev.icerock.moko.kswift")
}

kswift {
    install(dev.icerock.moko.kswift.plugin.feature.SealedToSwiftEnumFeature)
}
```

Rebuild the project and the kswift library generated for us the Swift api : 

```swift
public enum DestinationKs {

  case home
  case settings
  case storybook

  public var sealed: Destination {
    switch self {
    case .home:
      return shared.Destination.Home() as shared.Destination
    case .settings:
      return shared.Destination.Settings() as shared.Destination
    case .storybook:
      return shared.Destination.Storybook() as shared.Destination
    }
  }

  public init(_ obj: Destination) {
    if obj is shared.Destination.Home {
      self = .home
    } else if obj is shared.Destination.Settings {
      self = .settings
    } else if obj is shared.Destination.Storybook {
      self = .storybook
    } else {
      fatalError("DestinationKs not synchronized with Destination class")
    }
  }
}
```

Now we can access to the sealed class in a more Swift way :

```swift
let destination: Destination = .home
```
