## The problem

When you want to share a sealed class in a kotlin multiplatform module for a swift client, some infos are lost.

Indeed when you define a sealed class as it : 

```kotlin
sealed class Destination(val path: String, val icon: ImageVector) {
    object Home : Destination("home", Icons.Rounded.Home)
    object Storybook : Destination("storybook", Icons.Rounded.Refresh)
    object Settings : Destination("settings", Icons.Rounded.Settings)
}
```

The generated Swift code is : 

```swift
open class SharedDestination : KotlinBase {
    open class var companion: SharedDestination.Companion { get }
    open var path: String { get } 
    open var icon: UiImageVector { get }
}
```

But when you have for example a screen in compose multiplatform defined in kotlin : 

```kotlin
fun ScreenController( 
    currentDestination: Destination
): UIViewController = Application("ScreenControllerCM") {
    ...
}
```

And you want to display this screen in swift, we would like to do something like : 

```swift
ScreenController(currentDestination: SharedDestination.Home)
```

or, as type is inferred :

```swift
ScreenController(currentDestination: .Home)
```

But Home, Storybook and Settings are not available. How to make these sealed class work on Swift ?

## Solution

We are going to use [KSwift library](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-kswift) , a Swift-friendly api generator for Kotlin/Native frameworks. 

add in root build.gradle

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        google()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("dev.icerock.moko:kswift-gradle-plugin:0.6.1")
    }
}
````

add in project build.gradle

```
plugins {
    id("dev.icerock.moko.kswift")
}

kswift {
    install(dev.icerock.moko.kswift.plugin.feature.SealedToSwiftEnumFeature)
}
```

Rebuild the project and check the generated Swift code : 

```

```

Now we have the enum well generated according to the sealed class.
