Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is a novel technology developed by Jetbrains, which enables code sharing across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android.

In contrast to other technologies like Flutter, React Native, or Xamarin, where developers need to make a decision to share both UI and business logic between platforms, 
KMP emphasizes on non-UI business logic code sharing.

Currently, the most common use case of KMP is to share business logic code between Android and iOS apps. 

For Android developers, starting with KMP is a straightforward process, but for iOS developers, there is a steeper learning curve.

iOS developers must learn various aspects, including Android development frameworks, Kotlin programming language, Android Studio, Android build tools like Gradle, and Android UI frameworks.

Fortunately, several free resources are available to support the learning journey of iOS developers in KMP. 

These resources include the official [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile website](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html), practical use cases from companies using KMP in production, and sample projects for learning and reference.

In addition, these resources provide useful articles, tutorials, and libraries for KMP projects :

KMP is a new technology, and its ecosystem is still evolving. Nonetheless, with contributions from KMP enthusiasts, the ecosystem is growing quickly.
