In the world of mobile development, there's always a need for tools that simplify the process of creating high-quality, cross-platform UIs. 

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMP) has been making waves in this regard since its release in 2020, and now, with the announcement of Compose Multiplatform, things are about to get even more exciting!

## Breaking News! 

Compose Multiplatform 1.4.0 is finally here, and it's a game-changer. 

The best part? Compose for iOS is now officially public! 

This is a huge milestone for making shared mobile UIs a reality in the Kotlin ecosystem, using the APIs you already know from Jetpack Compose. 

## The next big thing

No more "internal" modifiers for public Composables in shared code. 

Say goodbye to writing separate code for each platform!

If you're already into Compose multiplatform, you know this is a big deal. 

This release signifies that the Compose multiplatform ecosystem is moving forward at lightning speed, and it's **quickly becoming the next big thing, just like Kotlin in 2017 and KMP in 2020**. 

This is an exciting development that signals the continued growth of Kotlin and its potential for cross-platform mobile development.

Alpha means the technology is becoming **more and more stable**, which is good news for developers looking to use Compose Multiplatform in their projects. 

With the ability to write less code in iOSMain or AndroidMain modules, developers can now share multiplatform UIs much easier than before, resulting in **faster development and fewer bugs**.

The future is looking bright for mobile development with this new support for iOS in Compose Multiplatform. 

As developers, we're always on the lookout for new tools and technologies that can help us create better apps, and Compose Multiplatform is definitely one of those tools.

## What's next

So, what's next for Compose Multiplatform? 

With this announcement, we can expect to see even more innovation and growth in the coming months and years. 

As the technology becomes more stable, we can expect to see more developers adopting it for their cross-platform mobile development needs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Compose Multiplatform 1.4.0 is a significant milestone for Kotlin and mobile development. 

It brings together the power of Jetpack Compose with cross-platform capabilities, allowing developers to write less code, create more stable apps, and share UIs between platforms. 

As Compose Multiplatform continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more exciting developments that will further change the mobile development landscape.
