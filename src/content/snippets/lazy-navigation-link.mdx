SwiftUI NavigationLink loads destination view immediately, without clicking

It can throw an error if a dependency is not yet initialized for example

```swift
struct NavigationLazyView<Content: View>: View {
    let build: () -> Content
    init(_ build: @autoclosure @escaping () -> Content) {
        self.build = build
    }
    var body: Content {
        build()
    }
}
```
 
Then the NavigationLink would look like this. You would place the View you want to be displayed inside ()

```swift
NavigationLink(destination: NavigationLazyView(DetailView(data: DataModel))) { Text("Item") }
```
